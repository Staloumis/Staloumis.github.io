### About Me

Welcome to my page â€“ This is my work that I've done in Bioinformatics! I have done analysis on Penguins, Oregon Spotted Frogs, and RNA sequences. 
I'm a Biology major student at Southern New Hampshire University and I'm planning to graduate in spring of 2026. I have been a part of the womens soccer team for the past four years which has taught me a lot about teamwork and building connections with each other on a personal level. During the summer, I work at Armbrook Village Senior Living Center where I am a waitress for residents with alzhiemers. This has brought me patience, perspective, and how to work efficently at a high pace. My experiences have transfered into how I complete my work and being capable of breaking down scientific language to be easily interpreted by everyone. 

### Sample Work Products

This was my first analysis using R Studio to observe different speceies of penguins on various islands. I created graphs to compare different variables in the data set and observed how they were similar and different. You can find my analysis 

### Oregon Spotted Frogs
